# The devhack schism

<small>This is a complicated document to write -m</small>

---

## Summary

One specific member joined devhack with misaligned expectations of what it was,
conflicting with both the original founding intentions and the understanding of
a large portion of the devhack active membership. In the 6 months of this
member's tenure, they contributed a great deal to the space but in the process
alienated most of the former membership contributing to various aspects of the
devhack project, including the original founding members and most
of the infrastructure team. 

This concluded in both a **ban** and a subsequent standoff, shouting match,
walk-out, and temporary closure by devhack membership on the space itself.

The resulting ban cascaded from increased disengagement of long-time
membership, reaching a tipping point that caused the leadership of devhack
decided to make a unilateral decision to remove this member. Even though they
were not communicated any warnings about this happening from leadership, this
should not have come as a suprise, as they had been subject to substantial moderation
-- from both devhack leadership and peers at the space.

## The night of the 28th of august

Two days after an amicable exit interview, approximately 30 minutes before the
townhall convened to discuss punitive board action, this person attempted to
enter the space with the help of a few supporters. Many members blockaded the
stairwell in response for some amount of time, before we decided to vacate the
premises and hold an informal discussion at a park a few blocks away.

During the blockade, this person was repeatedly asked to leave by devhack
membership while both they and their supporters recited washington state law,
questioned the space's insurance status, unintentionally injured themselves and
claimed they needed entry to the space for first aid, furled insults at devhack
leadership and their supporters, and generally were just very loud and did
quite a lot of emotional damage to those blockading the entrance and observers
to these events. They also threatened to get in contact with devhack business
partners to complain about our conduct throughout these events in an attempt to
tarnish devhack's business relationships.

## Consequences

Consequently, these four additional members were banned from devhack and barred access
for aiding in this person's attempted entry. One ban has been rescinded due to
overreach, and one is provisional due to their continued work with our
business partners.

Two of the banned members have threatened to enter the space with a police
escort, one of the banned members has claimed to have filed a police report.
One auxillary member has deferred all communications with us through legal
counsel.

These banned members have been invited to rightfully reclaim their personal
equipment hosted at the space in a supervised fashion, alongside other
members who have chosen to bow out. 
This has resulted in the loss of most of our networking equipment, most of our
radio equipment, some retro equipment we actually liked, lots of auxillary
tools, and other inconveniences.


## Background / flashpoints

A concrete list of flashpoints contributing to this person's removal:

- their introduction to the chatspace, and specifically infrastructure-related
  rooms, and subsequent disrespectful behaviour towards members resulted in a
  very explicit boundaries set by most of the infra team "we don't want to work
  with you and we're leaving the chats you look for help from us in".
- entitlement to an audience by people who have communicated they
  do not want to engage, further alienating core devhack contributors and
  causing them to disengage further.
- upon communication of boundaries and the results of their actions, they had a
  rather angry rant about the state of things with lots of words directed at
  both the infra team and the leadership of devhack, resulting in an [ask to
  leave](https://wiki.devhack.net/AskToLeave) from unrelated parties witnessing
  this. no further action was taken from this ATL.
- continuations of poor communication and collaboration skills during their
  attempted improvements of the space -- including being disrespectful and
  dismissive towards prior work done at the space and verbally attacking
  professional partners of devhack while degrading the physical security of the
  space and the reliability of our services. 
  The worst of this resulting in moderation action and subsequently met with an
  ATL invoked on the moderator by this person.


Now, I do want to stress, this person contributed substantial hours to the space,
just in a largely independent and uncommunicative manner; helping in some areas
and hurting in others. Ultimately, /dev/hack is a cooperative enterprise, and
undermining that cooperation harms the space more than volunteering helps it.

<!-- Now, I do want to stress, this person was being very helpful at the space and
doing a lot to try to improve it. They were just doing so without taking into
account any sort of reason for why things were done the way they were, doing so
without polling the devhack membership at large for support/consensus, and
generally just steamrolling progress without any sort of cooperation skills
with those who have previously put in work to make the space what it is. This
happened in part due to the fact that everyone who has previously put in work
at the space did not like how they were treated by this person and did not want
to speak to them or work with them in any respects beyond giving them
credentials and links to existing documentation surrounding the work they were
doing. -->

The ban was precipitated on our 13th member signalling their intention to leave
due to the behaviour from this person.


## learned lessons

Times remain fraught. Volunteers are burnt, disengaged, and trying their best to get
anything done to help the space.

That said, here are some direct actions we are taking to prevent these kinds of
events from *ever* happening again:

- Communicate the shared vision of devhack very clearly to guests and prospective members
- Communicate the existing structure of leadership within devhack --
  specifically that it is currently a benevolent dictatorship
- Be much less lenient towards toxic and antisocial behaviour -- communicating
  the bad behaviour to those doing it and giving them chances to improve, but
  also setting boundaries to remove them from spaces if they continue to do so.
- Moderating the chats much more strictly in-line with our code of conduct,
  implementing a moderation team that is disconnected from the board to do so.
