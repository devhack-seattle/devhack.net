office spaces aren't actually too expensive.

seattle hacker spaces are a thing?



step 1: garner/gauge interest
step 2: obligate some people into being in charge with me / starting it together & splitting the costs
step 3: find a space
step 4: move in
step 5: make it cool



things the hackerspace has:
seedbox
server shit
router
VR headset
old computers
projector setup
big ol UPS
