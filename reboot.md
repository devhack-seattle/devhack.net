# /dev/hack needs your help!

Due to [recent events](./lore/schism.html) the /dev/hack hackerspace has run into, we need help re-setting up the space!

Specifically, we need, in order of importance:

- [giveafuck](https://wiki.devhack.net/Giveafuck)
- labor
    - technical labor, with focus on network infrastructure, electrical wiring
    - manual labor. Carrying things around, lifting things, constructing things
- [money](https://donate.stripe.com/6oE4iaeXv8e7e0UaEG)
- **specifically approved** hardware, with preference to lower-power, usability, reliability
    - [#955](https://bugs.devhack.net/ticket/955)
    - [shopping tickets](https://bugs.devhack.net/query?keywords=~shopping&status=!closed&order=changetime&desc=1)
- cars & trucks to help bring things to the space
- drafting up & proposing policy
    - especially if you are leftist, anarchist, trans. we want your help and feedback
    - [policy tickets](https://bugs.devhack.net/query?component=Policy&status=!closed&order=changetime&desc=1)
