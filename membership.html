<h1>/dev/hack membership</h1>

<p>/dev/hack is actively seeking members who can support the existence of a 
space in our region devoted to our goals in education, creative 
projects, and community service. Becoming a member, while not required 
to take advantage of /dev/hack services, provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Around-the-clock key access to the /dev/hack space</li>
<li>The ability to reserve the /dev/hack space and for mission-related events and classes</li>
<li>Voting rights at official organizational meetings</li>
<li>Access to the /dev/hack members-only mailing list</li>
<li>Access to /dev/hack servers for projects</li>
<li>An email adress @devhack.net</li>
<li>An account on /dev/hack shell and VPS server</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, however, supporting /dev/hack as a member enables one 
to help build an innovative community technology space and to contribute
 to the growing international movement of hackerspaces.</p>
<h3><b>How to become a member</b></h3>
<p>Check us out first. Visit /dev/hack events and classes, and swing by the 
space to meet other members and get a feel for the group. All of our 
activities are free and open to the public.* Once you have decided you 
would like to join:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://buy.stripe.com/14kg0S2aJ9ibbSM6oo">Subscribe for dues ($50/month) via stripe.</a></li>
<li>Attend a monthly member meeting on the second Tuesday of the month 
at approximately 7:15PM, so your membership can be formalized.</li>
</ol>
<!-- <p>* Although events are free, sometimes materials costs for workshops 
are the responsibility of workshop participants. Further, because of 
space limitations, some events are capped at a maximum number of 
participants. Events are published <a title="HacDC's events calendar at meetup.com" href="https://www.meetup.com/hac-dc/events/">on our calendar</a>.</p> -->
