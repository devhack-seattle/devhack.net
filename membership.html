    <h1>/dev/hack membership</h1>

    <p>/dev/hack is actively seeking members who can support the existence of a
        space in our region devoted to our goals in education, creative
        projects, and community service. Becoming a member, while not required
        to take advantage of /dev/hack services, provides:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Around-the-clock key access to the /dev/hack space</li>
        <li>The ability to reserve the /dev/hack space and for mission-related events and classes</li>
        <li>Voting rights at official organizational meetings</li>
        <li>Access to /dev/hack servers for projects</li>
        <li>And other volunteer-provided <a href="https://wiki.devhack.net/Services">services</a> provided on a <i>best effort basis</i></li>
        <!--
        <li>An email adress @devhack.net</li>
        <li>Access to the /dev/hack members-only mailing list</li>
        <li>An account on /dev/hack shell and VPS server</li>
        -->
    </ul>
    <p>Most importantly, however, supporting /dev/hack as a member enables one
        to help build an innovative community technology space and to contribute
        to the growing international movement of hackerspaces.</p>
    <h3><b>How to become a member</b></h3>
    <p>Check us out first. Visit /dev/hack events and classes, and swing by the
        space to meet other members and get a feel for the group. All of our
        activities are free and open to the public. Once you have decided you
        would like to join:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://members.devhack.net/membership/new">Subscribe for dues ($50/month) via Stripe.</a></li>
        <li>Ask any member in the space for pointers on registering a keycard and getting access to your new membership
            benefits.</li>
        <li>Attend a monthly member meeting on the second Tuesday of the month
            at approximately 7:30 p.m., so your membership can be formalized.</li>
    </ol>
    <!-- <p>* Although events are free, sometimes materials costs for workshops 
are the responsibility of workshop participants. Further, because of 
space limitations, some events are capped at a maximum number of 
participants. Events are published <a title="HacDC's events calendar at meetup.com" href="https://www.meetup.com/hac-dc/events/">on our calendar</a>.</p> -->
    <h3>Managing your membership</h3>
    <p>You can update your payment information via <a href="https://members.devhack.net/membership/">the member portal</a>.
        If you would like to cancel your membership, you should also talk to someone to ensure that your accounts are winded down.
